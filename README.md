## Status
#### Ready!! :rocket:

After a long development period, we have finally released it to Google Play!
However, development is still ongoing and contributions are always welcome. Try building your app by following the section below.

#### [Download]() from GooglePlay

## Why?

I created this as a test of my own skills! It's like a portfolio. I wanted to deepen my knowledge of `Android`, `Kotlin`, and `Jetpack Compose`, and let people know about my capabilities. In addition, I was unsatisfied that existing music player apps could not display lyrics for music stored locally. Even subscription music services like Spotify can display lyrics.

## Architecture
This shows the architecture diagram of the app. It has become quite complex, so some modules and dependencies are omitted to give an overview.

## Contribute

This app uses Gradle's Convention Plugins to standardize the build logic, and all logic is described in a module called `build-logic`. For more information about this approach, please visit [nowinandroid](https://github.com/matsumo0922/nowinandroid/tree/main/build-logic).

If you find any bugs or want to improve a feature, or want to develop a new feature, please write an issue first. Then assign yourself and get to work on development. Pull requests are always welcome :smile:

When using the <a href="last.fm">Last.fm API</a> or <a href="https://www.musixmatch.com">Musixmatch API</a>, please add the API key to `local.properties`. By default, it is an empty string. For details, please read `app/build.gradle.kts`.
